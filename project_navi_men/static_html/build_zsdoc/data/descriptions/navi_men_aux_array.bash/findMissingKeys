## @brief Check which elements of the string-array passed as param1 are used
## as key in the associative string-array param2 and collect those strings
## - which are NOT used as keys - in the name-referenced string-array param3

## when testing/validating configuration jsons. Hence, returning string-list instead of boolean.
