## @fn
##
## @brief Check if only elements of the string-array passed as param1 are used
## as key in the associative string-array param2 and collect those strings
## - which ARE USED as keys - in the name-referenced string-array param3
##
## @note Passing an empty list as param2 skips the collection of invald keys.
##
## @note The output is inteded to be also used for the creation of complete error reports
## when testing/validating configuration jsons. Hence, returning string-list instead of boolean.
##
## @param1[in]  nria_find_invalid_keys_set: the test list with elements to be checked
##                                          no assumptions, duplicates allowed, not sorted, ...
## @param2[in]  nraa_find_invalid_keys_map: the associative-array with "check"-keys
##                                          no assumptions, however, duplicated keys are not possible
## @param3[out] nria_find_invalid_keys_missed_keys: return-list of elements not used as key
##
## @throws ERR_WRONG_NUM_OF_INPUTS: for wrong number of arguments
